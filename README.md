# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

### `Firebase command`

```

firebase use fir-37aa1
firebase deploy 
```

### reactfire

```
npm install --save reactfire firebase
```
### `npm run server`
Run db.json server, assume it's the backend server and store the data
Open http://localhost:5000/tasks

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
